This project is designed to fully automate the adjudication of Diplomacy games over Discord. The step-by-step process to
use this bot will be outlined in the near future.

Current limitations:

- The only variant you may play at this time is Imperial Diplomacy. An interface for easily adding variants will be
  added in the near future.

If you find any bugs or inconsistencies or wish to see new features (for game-running work you would rather not do
yourself or rather not subject your players to), please message icecream_guy on Discord.
